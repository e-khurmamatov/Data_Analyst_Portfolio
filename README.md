## Study Projects

### Python

| №     | Name | Description | Skills |
| :---: | ---- | ----------- | :----: |
| 1 | [Food Poisoning Claims Analysis][python-1] | Analysed claim compensation for food poisoning. Validated the data. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis. Provided visualisation. Conducted ANOVA, Chi-squared test of independence, and linear regression. Summarised the findings and gave recommendations. | Data manipulation and EDA using `pandas`, complex plots in `seaborn`, hypothesis testing with `pingouin` |  

### SQL

| №     | Name | Description | Skills |
| :---: | ---- | ----------- | :----: |
| 5 | [Unique Product Pairs Frequency in Orders][sql-5] | Found out which pairs of products are bought together most often based on the table with orders. | Arrays and array manipulation, `JOIN`s (incl. SELF JOIN), CTE, subqueries |
| 4 | [Analyzing Motorcycle Sales][sql-4] | Calculated net revenue for each product line, grouping results by month and warehouse for "Wholesale" orders only. | DATE/TIME manipulation, window functions, data manipulation |
| 3 | [Analyzing American Baby Name Trends][sql-3] | Determined how baby name preferences in the US changed since 1920, which names have kept popular for more than a century, and how they compare to the most recent top baby names | `CASE`, `LIKE`, subqueries, Common Table Expressions (CTE), and Window functions |
| 2 | [Analyze International Debt Statistics][sql-2] | Took a look at debt owed by countries across the globe. Extracted a few summary statistics from the data and unravelled some interesting facts and figures. Also validated findings to make sure the investigations were correct. | `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP`, `ORDER`, aggregate functions |
| 1 | [When Was the Golden Age of Video Games?][sql-1] | Analysed video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. Sought for a golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best. | `JOIN`, set theory, filtering data, `GROUP`, and `ORDER`. |
